# GOlang Blog

Blog that created with golang and vite react typescript. <br>
I code as hobby, so this repo might not get update. (and most of them not haha ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…)<br>

I'm not working as web developer or any IT related stuffs but just like to code, don't know why, just fun.<br>
work on food factory atm, haha <br>

PS: I hold JLPT N2 level and seeking for new job but i cant got any due to lack of my degree haha <br> <br>
After all, no one going to see my repo tho, why bother about it? don't know either haha <br>
just in case. <br>
worse part is, that i'm not holding bachelor degrees, haha
